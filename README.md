# Security of Information Systems Encryption Program

## Introduction

This C# program is designed to demonstrate various encryption methods for securing information systems. It includes implementations of the following encryption algorithms:

- **Book Cipher**: A symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a book or other pre-existing text to provide a key.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher that shifts the alphabet by a certain number of letters.
- **DES**: A symmetric-key block cipher that uses a 56-bit key.
- **Knapsack Cipher**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses a superincreasing sequence to generate a public key.
- **RSA**: An asymmetric encryption algorithm that uses two keys: one public and one private.
- **Trithemius Cipher**: A polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a table of alphabets.
- **XOR Cipher**: A simple encryption algorithm that uses the XOR operation.
